# Instructions and Steps for Using the Scripts

## Overview

After characterizing the nodes based on their chemical formula and type, the original MOFid-v1 was converted to MOFid-v2. This enhanced version includes detailed information about the chemical formula and type for better utility and analysis.

## Conversion Process

The conversion between SMILES and SELFIES representations was handled using the `selfies` library. For detailed steps on the transformation from MOFid-v1 to MOFid-v2, refer to the notebook [`convert_mofidv1_to_mofidv2`](./convert_mofidv1_to_mofidv2.ipynb), which provides a comprehensive explanation of the process.
